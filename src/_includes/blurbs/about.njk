    Marked Souls [MkS] is a North American based online gaming community which was originally created
    in 2007 as a Guild Wars guild. Marked Souls is primarily a PvE guild. You can expect guild missions, events,
    map commanders, fractals, strikes, dungeons, etc.
    We have experienced players willing to work with players that feel they need help in a specific area (game
    mode, class, etc.).
