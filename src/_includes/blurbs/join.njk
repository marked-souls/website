<p>
    In Marked Souls, participation in the community
    counts for a lot more than your current skill at the game. We have experienced players willing
    to work with players that feel they need help in a specific area (game mode, class, etc.).
</p>
<p>
    An ideal recruit:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>is respectful.</li>
    <li>has a good sense of humor</li>
    <li>enjoys playing with guild members</li>
    <li>strives to become a better player and teammate</li>
</ul>

<p>
    All members must pass a probation period, during which the player must show that they can fit in with the
    guildâ€™s expectations and current members.
