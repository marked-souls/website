<h4>What makes an ideal Marked Souls member?</h4>

An ideal recruit has a good sense of humor and enjoys playing with other guild members. Weâ€™re looking for members of any experience level that want to work with the guild to complete any and all content we face.

In Marked Souls, participation in the community counts for a lot more than your current skill at the game. We have experienced players willing to work with players that feel they need help in a specific area (game mode, class, etc.).
