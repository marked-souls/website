        As an explanatory first post, I will say this will be a fanfic.  My goal here is to connect the character I loved so much with the new character I love so much, those being my WoW Rogue with my GW2 Slyvari Warrior.

        Yes it will take some very creative liberties to jump from that world into this one, but I just can't make a new "Zhill".  It wouldn't be right.  So then I have to find some way to connect them.  This will be the log of his life (or unlife since he was undead), death in the world of GW2, and rebirth as a Sylvari.  This obviously breaks certain aspects of the lore.  But I say "screw lore!"  Seriously I have a way to tie it in that should be at least half-way acceptable.

        “Remarl Got Drunk” was a piece started by Remarl that turned into a long story based in the lore of Guild Wars co-written by members of Marked Souls. The following members contributed to the story: Remarl, Raven, Kousei, and Lyne.
