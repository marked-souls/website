<p>The following links have general information regarding raiding in Guild Wars 2. Marked Souls has also put a series of pages together to gather what we think are the best guides and resources for each encounter.</p>
<ul>
    <li><a href="https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Raid" target="_blank">Raid (Wiki)</a> - Official wiki raid information
    <li><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/6cbezg/a_collection_of_raid_boss_guides_for_forsaken/" target="_blank">A Collection of Raid Boss Guides (Reddit)</a> - This lists all the guides but isn't curated.
    <li><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/55vb2j/guide_getting_started_in_raids/" target="_blank">Getting Started in Raids (Reddit)</a> - Pretty good guide for players just starting out with raids.
    <li><a href="http://metabattle.com/wiki/Guide:Raid_Team_Composition" target="_blank">Raid Team Composition (Metabattle)</a> - Don't let the title of this guide fool you. It has a ton of good information including break numbers for conditions and skills.
    <li><a href="http://dulfy.net/category/gw2/raid-guides/" target="_blank">Raid Boss Encounter Guides (Dulfy)</a> - Text guides to the raid bosses with some videos showing the fights. Few videos contain explanations.
