I really do hope our success last night is repeatable. We were able to defeat Urgoz's Warren (normal mode) in a total time of 1 hour and 32 minutes. The best news: I was able to play Kousei using a Ursan Blessing build (tweaked to W/N for Necrotic Transversal). I loved being able to use my warrior in Urgoz for a change!
