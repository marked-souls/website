This article is not to tell you whether or not to keep items but to help you in deciding what collectable drops you think are worth keeping.

<h4>Profitable Rewards</h4>

These rewards once traded for will make you more gold than selling the collectable items themselves.

The entire list of profitable rewards can be found: [http://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Category:Profitable\_trophies](http://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Category:Profitable_trophies "Profitable Collector Items"). It's a pretty handy list to have bookmarked with the new storage upgrades.
