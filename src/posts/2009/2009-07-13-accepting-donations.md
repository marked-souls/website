The leadership of Marked Souls is now accepting donations for those that would like to help pay for the expenses of the year.

With Aion around the corner, we will be upgrading to a 35 user Ventrilo server. This server is $100.80 a year but since we'll be upgrading in the middle of the year it'll only cost $65.74 right now.

We have left the donation amount open so if you choose to donate feel free to donate any amount ($1, $5, $10, etc).

The donation button will be taken offline once we have reached our current goal. We will be using this button every year from now on to try and keep our Community running smoothly while spreading the burden of our expenses.
