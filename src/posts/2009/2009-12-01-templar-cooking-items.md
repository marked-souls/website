The following are recommended Food and Drink items for Templars with cooking level and description next to each. I have placed a star (\*) next to my personal favorite within each category.

**Foods**

- Starturtle Aether Steak (420) - Physical Attack increases by 10 and Maximum HP increase by 200 points, and Flight Time also increases by 10 seconds for 30 min.
- Starturtle Steak (395) - Physical Attack increases by 10 and Maximum HP increase by 200 points for 30 min.
- Calydon Meat Dumpling \* (385) - Physical Crit increases by 50 and Accuracy increase by 50 points for 30 min.

**Drinks**

- Lunime Cocktail (385) - Natural Healing increases by 10 and Natural Mana Treatment increase by 15 points for 30 min.
- Cellatu Porridge \* (365) - Natural Healing and Natural Mana Treatment increase by 12 and 18 points respectively for 30 min. There is a low chance of getting a stomach ache due to the poison of Cellatu. (If you're going to run this be sure to have healing potions to remove the possible debuff.)

The benefits of cooking may not be well known to you now but these foods can give buffs valuable in both PvE and PvP scenarios.
