We've been hard at work on our charter. We've re-organized it on our website and added new content. The following is a brief overview of the new content we've added to the charter.

### New Rank: Veteran

The Veteran rank exists to acknowledge members that have went above and beyond for the guild. It cannot be achieved just by playing for a certain amount of time but must be earned through dedication, support, and gamesmanship. It is a title meant to show that the member has done something for the guild worthy of recognition, respect, and the perks.

Crafting officers ensure that craft masters receive all needed recipes and requests. Crafting officers handle guild storage requests pertaining to crafting items.

### Council

The Council is the governing body of Marked Souls. A council member must have knowledge of the guild, what it stands for, and ultimately where it needs to be lead and nurtured. To be deemed qualified for the Council, a member must be well respected leader within the guild.

### Craft Master System

We've added the details of what we are calling our Craft Master System, or CMS, to the charter. This is a variation of the system we created when playing Aion. The system is designed to ensure that members always have access to someone with a large recipe library.
