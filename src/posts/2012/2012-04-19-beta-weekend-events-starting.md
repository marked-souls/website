Pre-purchase players get ready. The semi-public BWE's will be starting on April 27, 2012. These will be the first events that are not under NDA so expect to see a lot more content than the previous closed betas.

> We’re counting the days until the first public Guild Wars 2 Beta Weekend Event, which begins on Friday, April 27, at noon PDT (GMT-8) and ends on Sunday, April 29, at 11:59 p.m. PDT (GMT-8). Hundreds of thousands of players from around the world will get their first taste of Guild Wars 2—and rest assured, we’ll be playing alongside them!
