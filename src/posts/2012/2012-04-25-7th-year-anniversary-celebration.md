> The Year of the Dragon marks seven sensational years of Guild Wars, and we want you to join us for our biggest anniversary party ever.
> 
> It’s time once again to throw open the Shing Jea Boardwalk, rev up the Rollerbeetles, and don our party hats for two weeks of festive fun from April 24th to May 8th. In addition to the usual games and gifts, we’re packing this party with drops and activities never before seen in an anniversary celebration!

Besides the normal festival drops, this year the prize is a new charmable pet, the Hound of Balthazar.
