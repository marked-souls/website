> Earlier this year I told you that 2012 would be the Year of the Dragon, and that the next few betas would help us nail down our actual launch date. Well, after the results of our latest stress test, I’m happy to announce that we’re ready to nail down that date. Guild Wars 2 will officially launch on Tuesday, August 28th.

Well it's finally here. We have an official release date from ANET! Read more about the release date and final beta: [http://www.arena.net/blog/announcing-the-guild-wars-2-launch-date](http://www.arena.net/blog/announcing-the-guild-wars-2-launch-date)
